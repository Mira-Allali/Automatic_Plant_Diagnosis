# Automatic Plant Diagnosis  
Deep Learning vs Classical Machine Learning for Plant Disease Classification

## Abstract

This project presents a comparative study between Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning approaches for automated plant disease diagnosis using image data.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is compared against a PCA + Support Vector Machine (SVM) pipeline. The objective is to analyze performance differences, scalability, and robustness across methodologies.

The study highlights the superiority of deep learning for raw image classification tasks while providing a rigorous baseline using traditional ML methods.

## Methodology

### 🔵 Deep Learning Approach

- Custom Convolutional Neural Network
- Data Augmentation (Flip, Rotation, Zoom, Contrast)
- Rescaling Normalization
- Adam Optimizer
- Early Stopping
- Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

The CNN learns hierarchical spatial features directly from raw pixel data.

---

### 🟠 Classical Machine Learning Approach

- Image flattening
- Feature extraction
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 5-Fold Cross Validation

This pipeline provides a computational baseline and interpretable feature reduction strategy.

---

## Experimental Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| CNN | ~94% |
| PCA + SVM | ~65% |
| K-Fold Mean Accuracy | ~65% |
| K-Fold Std | ~0.004 |

### Interpretation

- CNN significantly outperforms classical ML on high-dimensional image data.
- PCA + SVM suffers from information loss due to dimensionality reduction.
- Deep learning scales better with dataset size and complexity.
