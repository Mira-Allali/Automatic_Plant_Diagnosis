# Automatic Plant Diagnosis  
Deep Learning vs Classical Machine Learning for Plant Disease Classification

## Abstract

This project presents a comparative study between Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning approaches for automated plant disease diagnosis using image data.

The problem is formulated as a **supervised multi-class image classification task**, where an input image of a plant leaf is mapped to a predefined disease category.

A **transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (MobileNetV2)** is compared against a **PCA + Support Vector Machine (SVM)** pipeline. The objective is to evaluate performance, robustness, and scalability across fundamentally different paradigms.

Results demonstrate the superiority of deep learning models for high-dimensional visual data, while classical methods provide a valuable interpretable baseline.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Palm Leaf Disease Dataset**.

Source:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/rabiehoussaini/palm-deseas-detection/input

⚠️ The dataset is not included in this repository.

### Expected structure:

## Problem Formulation

The task is defined as:

- **Input**: RGB image of a plant leaf  
- **Output**: Probability distribution over disease classes  

The predicted label corresponds to: argmax P(y | x)

This is a **supervised multi-class classification problem**.

## Methodology

### 🔵 Deep Learning Approach

- **Model**: MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Transfer Learning**:
  - Frozen base model (feature extractor)
  - Fine-tuning of top layers
- **Preprocessing**:
  - MobileNetV2 normalization
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Flip, rotation, zoom, brightness, contrast
- **Regularization**:
  - Dropout
  - Batch normalization
- **Optimization**:
  - Adam optimizer
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Early stopping

The CNN automatically learns hierarchical visual features from raw images.

### 🟠 Classical Machine Learning Approach

- Image resizing + grayscale conversion
- Flattening (vectorization)
- Standardization
- PCA (dimensionality reduction)
- SVM (RBF kernel)
- 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation

This pipeline provides:
- Lower computational cost
- Interpretable feature compression
- Baseline comparison

---

### 🟣 Synthetic Data Generation

A secondary dataset is generated using data augmentation:

- Random flip
- Rotation
- Zoom
- Contrast / brightness variation

Purpose:
- Increase dataset diversity
- Improve model generalization
- Reduce overfitting

---

## Experimental Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| CNN | ~82% |
| PCA + SVM | ~35% |
| K-Fold Mean Accuracy | ~35% |
| K-Fold Std | ~0.011 |

### Interpretation

- CNN significantly outperforms classical ML on image data
- PCA introduces information loss
- Transfer learning improves convergence and accuracy
- SVM remains a useful lightweight baseline
